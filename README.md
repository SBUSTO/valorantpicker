# OVERVIEW

This is my capstone project for CODE: You. It is a recreation of a website called "https://www.valorantpicker.com/#/". I did my best to recreate the majority of it's functionality. While the CSS is not the best, I tried to focus on the requirements and what was more important to be met by rubric requirements. I used a VALORANT API to integrate the agents, and display their portraits. 

# INSTRUCTIONS 

This website is pretty straight forward to use! You can click the "Get Random Agent" button to randomly generate an agent from all agents. You can also click "select all", or alternatively, "unselect all" to select/unselect all agents in that category. You can select all in just one category, or multiple. 

Apologies that my CSS does not reflect when the agents are selected, there should be some :hover or :selected but I was having trouble getting it to work.

When you refresh the page, local storage is being utilized to continue to display an agent's potrait under the "You should play" header.


# TO DO:

I want to create a website that shows a lists of groups of agents.

Each group of agents will have multiple agents that you can select.

You can select one agent.

You can select all agents.

You can select all agents in a group.

You can deselect all selected agents or all agents in one group.

You can pick a random agent out of all of the agents or all of the agents that you have picked.

# REQUIREMENTS MET: 

- Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.

- Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.

- Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.

- Persist data to an external API and make the stored data accessible in your app (including after reload/refresh).
